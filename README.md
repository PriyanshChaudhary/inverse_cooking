This model allows you to know how a dish came to life. The ingredients, the process, everything that was reqd. to make it from an image of the dish itself.
If you are already an ML learner or even a beginner in this field, you might have thought of how this model was built.
Well the first thing that comes to mind is image recognition of the food and then predicting the dishes on the model trained on a large dataset. 

Congratulations,
if you've thought along these lines you have made a good invesment of your time in this field. But you are half right. Though indeed we did an image prediction on the images, we instead of an entire inage were more focused on the ingredient pipeline.
